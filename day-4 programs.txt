program3:-
get one string with one input along with char & find& display whther char is present in string or not

x=input("enter a string:").split( )
ch=input ("enter a character:")
for i in range(len(x)):
    if ch==x[i]:
        print("character is in the string",ch)
    else:

program4:-
check whether the string is palindrome or not
n=input("enter a string")
a=0
x=len(n)-1
while a<=x:
    if n[a]!=n[x]:
        print("it is not plandrome")

        print("it is plandrome")
        break

output:-
enter a stringpop
it is plandrome

program5:-
after get the one string as input ,check your string contains the space or not if yes  count no of space & print it

s=input("enter the string")
v=0
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i]==' ':
        v+=1
        print("space is present")
        
    else:
        print("space is not present")

program6:-
create a list as vowels and get a string and count.
s=input("enter a string:")
l=['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']
count=0
for i in range (len(s)):
    for j in range(len(l)):
