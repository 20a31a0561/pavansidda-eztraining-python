**********************TREE*************************************************
tree  contains the parent node also called root of the node and where childern node called it as leaf node.
tree alwys check from root->leftsubtree->rightsubtree
In  top of the tree takens downwards from root to leafnode.
In  depth of the tree takens upwards from leafnode to root. 
A BINARY TREE having the node that contains the maximum only the two chidren

 BINARY TREE TRANVERSAL:-
preorder-->root-->left-->right-(or)RLR(OR)DLR
postorder-->left-->right-->root-(or)LRR(OR)LRD
inorder-->left-->root-->right-(or)LRR(OR)LDR

LDR-Means root or data
these order are depth first search


TYPES OF BINARY TREE
1.FULL BINARY TREE:-all node will have the zero and two child.
2.DEGENRATE TREE:-internal node has the onechild or zero child.
3.SKEWED BINARY TREE:-The tree follows one direction completely either left or right
these are twio types:-
1.left skewed binary tree
2.right skewed binary tree

### other based on the level:-
1.complete level:-every level should be complete
in last level if its in complete nodes should present at extreme left side

2.perfect level:-
all internal nodes has two chidren and leaf node should has two children

3.balanced level:-for the all the node height(left subtree)-height(right subtree) can be 0 or 1 then it is called as balanced tree.

****BINARY SERACH TREE***************
all the leftside element should be lesserthan its parents.
all the rightside elements should be greater than its parents.
